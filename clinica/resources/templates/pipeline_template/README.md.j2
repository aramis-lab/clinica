<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>


## Dependencies
<!-- If you installed the docker image of Clinica, nothing is required. -->
If you only installed the core of Clinica, this pipeline needs the installation of **<software_package>** on your computer. You can find how to install this software on the [installation](../#installing-clinica-from-source) page.


## Running the pipeline
The pipeline can be run with the following command line:

```
clinica run {{ pipeline.command_name }} bids_directory caps_directory
```
where:

  - `bids_directory` is the input folder containing the dataset in a [BIDS](../BIDS) hierarchy.
  - `caps_directory` is the output folder containing the results in a [CAPS](../CAPS) hierarchy.
  - `<ARG_1>` <ARG_1_DESCRIPTION>
  - `<ARG_2>` <ARG_2_DESCRIPTION>

If you want to run the pipeline on a subset of your BIDS dataset, you can use the `-tsv` flag to specify in a TSV file the participants belonging to your subset.

    If you have


## Outputs

Results are stored in the following folder of the [CAPS hierarchy](docs/CAPS): `subjects/sub-<participant_label>/ses-<session_label>/<some_folder>`.

The main output files are:

  - `<source_file>_labelname1-<label>_mainouput1`: description main output 1.

  - `<source_file>_labelname1-<label>_mainouput2`: description main output 2.

The full list of output files can be found in the [ClinicA Processed Structure (CAPS) Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mjXbqRceHK0fD0BIONniLK713zY7DbQHJEV7kxqsd8/edit#heading=h.f4ddnk971gkn).
