AICHA is an atlas of intrinsic connectivity of homotopic areas. 
It derives from Joliot M, Jobard G, Naveau M, Delcroix N, Petit L, Zago L, Crivello F, Mellet E, Mazoyer B & Tzourio-Mazoyer N (2015) . Journal of Neuroscience Methods 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.07.013. (PDF)

Overview:
AICHA (for Atlas of Intrinsic Connectivity of Homotopic Areas) is a functional brain ROIs atlas based on resting-state fMRI data acquired in 281 individuals. AICHA ROIs cover the whole cerebrum, each having 1- homogeneity of its constituting voxels intrinsic activity, and 2- a unique homotopic contralateral counterpart with which it has maximal intrinsic connectivity.

The AICHA atlas includes 192 couples of homotopic regions for a total of 384 regions. AICHA is provided in the MNI stereotaxic space (MNI ICBM 152, Template sampling size of 2x2x2 mm3 voxels; bounding box, x = -90 to 90 mm, y = -126 to 91 mm, z = -72 to 109 mm).

AICHA atlas includes both regions located in the crown of the gyri (named Gyrus, region name beginning by “G_”) and regions located in the depth of the sulci (named Suclus, region name beginning by “S_”). In addition the subcortical nuclei were labeled separately (name Nucleus, region name beginning by “N_”). 
Different parcels belonging to the same anatomical region were labeled with numbers (starting to 1). For example the precuneus show as 9 subparts labeled from G_Precuneus-1-L to G_Precuneus-9-L.
