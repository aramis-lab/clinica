Hammers atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This atlas, based on Alexander Hammers' brain atlas, made available for the 
Euripides project, Nov 2009 (A). 

CAT12 was used to segment the T1 data and estimate Dartel normalization to the
VBM IXI550 template for each subject. Dartel mapping was then applied for label
map. A 3D median filter was used to remove outliers in the label map. ROI-IDs 
were reseted to guaranty that left side ROIs were described by odd numbers, 
whereas right-hand side ROIs only have even numbers. ROIs without side-alignment 
in the original atlas like the brainstem were broken into a right and left part.
Therefore, a Laplace filter was used to estimate the potential field of unaligned
regions between the left an right potential. If most or no side alignment in the
original map was available, a side label map from the anatomy toolbox of SPM was
used.
