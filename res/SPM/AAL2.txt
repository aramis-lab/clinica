Overview
An alternative parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex is described for the automated anatomical labeling atlas of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002) (Automated anatomical labeling of activations in SPM using a macroscopic anatomical parcellation of the MNI MRI single-subject brain. NeuroImage 15:273-289). The new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex follows the description provided by Chiavaras, Petrides, and colleagues (2000, 2001).

 The AAL atlas is probably the most widely used cortical parcellation map in connectomic literature. It can be downloaded from the website: http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL2?lang=en and it consists on 120 regions which parcellate che cortical and subcortical area.
