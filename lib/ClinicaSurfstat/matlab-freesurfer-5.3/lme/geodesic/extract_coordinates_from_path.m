function [x,y,z] = extract_coordinates_from_path(path)

%this elegant way is incompatible with the older versions of matlab
% x = cellfun(@(p) p.x, path);    %the simplest way to extract coordinates from the path
% y = cellfun(@(p) p.y, path);    %if it looks complicated, you can use "for" similar to example1.m
% z = cellfun(@(p) p.z, path);
