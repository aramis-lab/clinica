# The script iterates each time on all branches to compile the pages.
# The artifact needs to contain all the pages and I don't see any
# mean to combine all the artifacts produced by all the branches 
# (There is the "needs:" field in .gitlab.yml to invoke an artifact
# produced by an other branch, but this would require to hard-wire all
# the branch names in .gitlab.yml...)

# $branches get all the branch names.
# Remotes refs are of the form "refs/remotes/origin/branch-name"
# so we strip the three first path components to keep only "branch-name".
# We don't keep neither "dont_publish.*" branches nor HEAD branch.
