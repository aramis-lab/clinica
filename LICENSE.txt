AAL2 is the implementation of a new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex in
the automated anatomical labeling atlas.

———————
Overview
An alternative parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex is described for the
automated anatomical labeling atlas of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002) (Automated
anatomical labeling of activations in SPM using a macroscopic anatomical
parcellation of the MNI MRI single-subject brain. NeuroImage 15:273-289). The
new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex follows the description provided
by Chiavaras, Petrides, and colleagues (2000, 2001).

———————
 The AAL atlas is probably the most widely used cortical parcellation map in
 connectomic literature. It can be downloaded from the website:
 http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL2?lang=en and it consists on 120 regions which
 parcellate the cortical and subcortical area.

AICHA is an atlas of intrinsic connectivity of homotopic areas.
It derives from Joliot M, Jobard G, Naveau M, Delcroix N, Petit L, Zago L,
Crivello F, Mellet E, Mazoyer B & Tzourio-Mazoyer N (2015) . Journal of
Neuroscience Methods 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.07.013. (PDF)
 ——————
Overview:
AICHA (for Atlas of Intrinsic Connectivity of Homotopic Areas) is a functional
brain ROIs atlas based on resting-state fMRI data acquired in 281 individuals.
AICHA ROIs cover the whole cerebrum, each having 1- homogeneity of its
constituting voxels intrinsic activity, and 2- a unique homotopic contralateral
counterpart with which it has maximal intrinsic connectivity.  This atlas is
protected by copyright; you can freely use it for none profit research
purposes, providing the above reference is cited. For other use please contact
us through aicha.gin.brainatlas at gmail.com The AICHA atlas includes 192
couples of homotopic regions for a total of 384 regions. AICHA is provided in
the MNI stereotaxic space (MNI ICBM 152, Template sampling size of 2x2x2 mm3
voxels; bounding box, x = -90 to 90 mm, y = -126 to 91 mm, z = -72 to 109 mm).

AICHA atlas includes both regions located in the crown of the gyri (named
Gyrus, region name beginning by “G_”) and regions located in the depth of the
sulci (named Suclus, region name beginning by “S_”). In addition the
subcortical nuclei were labeled separately (name Nucleus, region name beginning
by “N_”).  Different parcels belonging to the same anatomical region were
labeled with numbers (starting to 1). For example the precuneus show as 9
subparts labeled from G_Precuneus-1-L to G_Precuneus-9-L.

LPBA40 atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40) is a series of maps of brain
anatomic regions. These maps were produced from a set of whole-head MRI of 40
human volunteers. Each MRI was manually delineated to identify a set of 56
structures in the brain, most of which are within the cortex. These
delineations were then transformed into a common atlas space to produce a set
of coregistered anatomical labels. The original MRI data were also transformed
into the atlas space.
