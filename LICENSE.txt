AAL2 is the implementation of a new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex in the automated anatomical labeling atlas.
Rolls ET, Joliot M & Tzourio-Mazoyer N (2015) . NeuroImage 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.075
———————
Overview
An alternative parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex is described for the automated anatomical labeling atlas of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002) (Automated anatomical labeling of activations in SPM using a macroscopic anatomical parcellation of the MNI MRI single-subject brain. NeuroImage 15:273-289). The new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex follows the description provided by Chiavaras, Petrides, and colleagues (2000, 2001).

———————
 The AAL atlas is probably the most widely used cortical parcellation map in connectomic literature. It can be downloaded from the website: http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL2?lang=en and it consists on 120 regions which parcellate che cortical and subcortical area.

AICHA is an atlas of intrinsic connectivity of homotopic areas.
It derives from Joliot M, Jobard G, Naveau M, Delcroix N, Petit L, Zago L, Crivello F, Mellet E, Mazoyer B & Tzourio-Mazoyer N (2015) . Journal of Neuroscience Methods 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.07.013. (PDF)
 ——————
Overview:
AICHA (for Atlas of Intrinsic Connectivity of Homotopic Areas) is a functional brain ROIs atlas based on resting-state fMRI data acquired in 281 individuals. AICHA ROIs cover the whole cerebrum, each having 1- homogeneity of its constituting voxels intrinsic activity, and 2- a unique homotopic contralateral counterpart with which it has maximal intrinsic connectivity.
This atlas is protected by copyright; you can freely use it for none profit research purposes, providing the above reference is cited. For other use please contact us through aicha.gin.brainatlas at gmail.com
The AICHA atlas includes 192 couples of homotopic regions for a total of 384 regions. AICHA is provided in the MNI stereotaxic space (MNI ICBM 152, Template sampling size of 2x2x2 mm3 voxels; bounding box, x = -90 to 90 mm, y = -126 to 91 mm, z = -72 to 109 mm).

AICHA atlas includes both regions located in the crown of the gyri (named Gyrus, region name beginning by “G_”) and regions located in the depth of the sulci (named Suclus, region name beginning by “S_”). In addition the subcortical nuclei were labeled separately (name Nucleus, region name beginning by “N_”).
Different parcels belonging to the same anatomical region were labeled with numbers (starting to 1). For example the precuneus show as 9 subparts labeled from G_Precuneus-1-L to G_Precuneus-9-L.

Hammers atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This atlas, based on Alexander Hammers' brain atlas, made available for the
Euripides project, Nov 2009 (A).

CAT12 was used to segment the T1 data and estimate Dartel normalization to the
VBM IXI550 template for each subject. Dartel mapping was then applied for label
map. A 3D median filter was used to remove outliers in the label map. ROI-IDs
were reseted to guaranty that left side ROIs were described by odd numbers,
whereas right-hand side ROIs only have even numbers. ROIs without side-alignment
in the original atlas like the brainstem were broken into a right and left part.
Therefore, a Laplace filter was used to estimate the potential field of unaligned
regions between the left an right potential. If most or no side alignment in the
original map was available, a side label map from the anatomy toolbox of SPM was
used.

LPBA40 atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40) is a series of maps of brain anatomic regions. These maps were produced from a set of whole-head MRI of 40 human volunteers. Each MRI was manually delineated to identify a set of 56 structures in the brain, most of which are within the cortex. These delineations were then transformed into a common atlas space to produce a set of coregistered anatomical labels. The original MRI data were also transformed into the atlas space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delineation

MRI data from 40 subjects were preprocessed according to existing LONI protocols to produce skull-stripped brain volumes. These volumes were aligned to the ICBM305 atlas using rigid-body transformation to correct for head tilt and reduce bias in the delineation process. This produced a transform from native space to delineation space and an associated inverse transform. In each of the 40 subjects, 58 structures were delineated manually according to protocols developed for this project (see LPBA40 Protocols) using BrainSuite.

Image processing

Brain masks were constructed from the manual delineations and projected back to the native delineation space. The MRI volumes in native space were masked to produce brain-only MRI volumes. These volumes were then corrected for non-uniformity using BrainSuite's Bias Field Corrector. The bias-corrected brain data were processed with the Partial Volume Classifier software to produce maps of grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each subject volume. The brains were then aligned to atlas targets using 3 widely used methods. The atlas targets were chosen based on the method.

Atlas construction

For each of the three atlas variants, we constructed a series of maps from the transformed data.

Intensity atlas (LPBA40intensityavg) - a voxel-wise average of the skull-stripped MRI volumes in ICBM452 space

Tissue class probabilistic atlas (LPBA40tissue) - three volumes, where each voxel contains a count of the number of subject volumes that had that voxel labeled as a the associated tissue type (GM, WM, or CSF)

Structure probability maps (LPBA40structure) - 56 volumes, each of which contains the voxel-wise count of the number of subjects that had that voxel labeled as the given structure

Grey matter masked structure probability maps (LPBA40GMstructure) - 56 volumes, each of which contains the voxel-wise count of the number of subjects that had that voxel labeled as the given structure and also as GM

Maximum likelihood atlas (LPBA40) - for each voxel, we computed the most likely tissue type based on the 40 delineated subject volumes; in the case of a tie, the tissue type was chosen at random from the equilikely labels. This data set contains both the maximum likelihood label volume and a volume composed of the maximum count at each voxel

Maximum likelihood grey matter atlas (LPBA40) - This is similar to LPBA40, above, but the tissue labels were pre before performing the maximum likelihood computation

Please see https://masi.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/workshop2012/index.php/Important_Dates for dates.
Click Watch on the bar above to be notified via e-mail when this page is updated (you must create a free account - see the upper right).

Grand Challenge Rules

Submission Information
See Submission Information for details on how to submit labels.

Contest Data
On approximately April 1, 2012, the following data will be made available after registration (see below).
Training Atlas Pairs: 15 datasets for distinct human data consisting of a de-faced T1-weighted structural MRI dataset and as associated manually labeled volume with one label per voxel. Each volume (MRI and label) will be stored in a separate 3D NiFTI file. These files will be properly interpreted by the MIPAV software package (freely available). (from the "reliability" OASIS data set: Challenge_Demographics).
Testing Target MRI: 20 T1-weighted structural MRI datasets of 15 distinct subjects. (Challenge_Demographics).
Training and Testing demographics (age, gender handedness) will be available here
A spreadsheet of all considered labels can be found here -- see evaluation procedures for further label information.

Evaluation Procedures
Please see https://masi.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/workshop2012/index.php/Important_Dates for dates.
Proof of paper "preliminary" manuscripts for grand challenge submissions will be accepted. Manuscripts must be in the format indicated below.
After submission of a preliminary manuscript, contestants will be given an access code to upload labeled target MRI datasets through this website. Within 24 hours of upload, the contact author will be e-mailed a PDF of quantitative performance results. The primary metric for the grand challenge contest is the mean Dice similarity coefficient across all brain labels and all subjects in the "testing target" cohort. The list of anatomical labels is here. A discussion of the Statistical Power of the challenge is provided here.

Resubmissions of different label results are permitted within the evaluation window. We understand that technical glitches, format errors, etc. may lead to misleading error metrics. The organizers encourage (and will assist with) multiple submissions to address such errors. The last submission of label results under an access code will be considered the authors final submission.

We strongly advocate against parameter tuning based on the hidden testing labels during the evaluation window. The number of submissions will be recorded on the summary PDF and must be reported in the final publication. Submission of multiple similar algorithms for evaluation is encouraged. Please use a different preliminary manuscript for each algorithm variant. Text may be shared among manuscript submissions.

Additional Evaluation Information
We only compared against labels that appeared consistently across all of the datasets. As a result, we ignored some of the labels during the calculation of the results. In MATLAB notation, the label numbers that we ignored are:
ignore_labels = [1:3, 5:10, 12:22, 24:29, 33:34, 42:43, 53:54, 63:68, 70, 74, 80:99, 110:111, 126:127, 130:131, 158:159, 188:189];
Anywhere that any of these labels appear on the "true" (manual) labels are automatically set to 0 (background) on both the "true" labels and the estimated labels in order to avoid biasing the results.
After ignoring these labels we are left with 134 labels that count. The resulting DSC values on these labels are what is reported on the results page.
The labels were evaluated in three groups:
1) Cortical Labels: All non-ignored labels >= 100
2) Non-Cortical Labels: All non-ignored labels > 0 and < 100
3) Overall: All non-ignored labels.


Manuscript Preparation
Papers submitted in response to the Grand Challenge should conform to the MICCAI formatting instructions, with the modifications explained below:
Maximum author-generated manuscript length is 4 pages.
The PDF report generated by the evaluation process must be included as a single supplementary final page (for a total of 5 pages).

Submitted in PDF format
Color illustrations in the PDF are not subject to fees.
The preliminary manuscript may be revised up until June 12, 2012.

Validation (Hidden) Data
The hidden true labels will be revealed July 1, 2012 and made available to all authors who submitted a response to the workshop challenge. Additionally, the full source code of the program used to generate the evaluation PDF's will be made public.

Terms of Use for Data Provided During the Contest
The data will be released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) with no end date. Users should credit the MRI scans as originating from the OASIS project and the labeled data as "provided by Neuromorphometrics, Inc. (http://Neuromorphometrics.com/) under academic subscription". These references should be included in all workshop and final publications.

Availability of Data after Contest Completion
After the completion of the contest, testing/training data will be available from this website after users agree to the license terms.
After the completion of the contest, please contact Neuromorphometrics (http://neuromorphometrics.com/) for additional details relevant to this dataset.

Eligibility
No individual who has access to the labeled testing datasets is permitted to submit a response to this grand challenge. Specifically, employees, affiliates or contractors for Neuromorphometrics are not permitted to participate in any contest entry.
It is assumed that the majority of entrants will seek to use multi-atlas method to respond to this challenge. However, any method of labeling the testing datasets is permitted as long as the approach is described in a reproducible manner.

Software Sharing
Contestants are encouraged (but not required) to make available the software, tools, and source code for the methods used in response to this challenge. However, software and code sharing are not required for participation.

Contest Results
After the workshop (after October 5, 2012), a summary of all methods will be presented here. We will publish a citable book (with ISBN) with a compilation of all results and a summary of rankings. This book will be available at cost (or no cost, if possible) – neither editors nor their institutions will receive any compensation for this publication. On this website, we will make available copies of all papers, the label masks submitted for each method, the PDF result files for each method, and (if the authors desire) additional resources (software/code/etc.) that a reader may find relevant to each paper.
