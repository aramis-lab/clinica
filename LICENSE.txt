AAL2 is the implementation of a new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex in the automated anatomical labeling atlas.
Rolls ET, Joliot M & Tzourio-Mazoyer N (2015) . NeuroImage 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.075
———————
Overview
An alternative parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex is described for the automated anatomical labeling atlas of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002) (Automated anatomical labeling of activations in SPM using a macroscopic anatomical parcellation of the MNI MRI single-subject brain. NeuroImage 15:273-289). The new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex follows the description provided by Chiavaras, Petrides, and colleagues (2000, 2001).

———————
 The AAL atlas is probably the most widely used cortical parcellation map in connectomic literature. It can be downloaded from the website: http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/AAL2?lang=en and it consists on 120 regions which parcellate the cortical and subcortical area.

AICHA is an atlas of intrinsic connectivity of homotopic areas.
It derives from Joliot M, Jobard G, Naveau M, Delcroix N, Petit L, Zago L, Crivello F, Mellet E, Mazoyer B & Tzourio-Mazoyer N (2015) . Journal of Neuroscience Methods 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.07.013. (PDF)
 ——————
Overview:
AICHA (for Atlas of Intrinsic Connectivity of Homotopic Areas) is a functional brain ROIs atlas based on resting-state fMRI data acquired in 281 individuals. AICHA ROIs cover the whole cerebrum, each having 1- homogeneity of its constituting voxels intrinsic activity, and 2- a unique homotopic contralateral counterpart with which it has maximal intrinsic connectivity.
This atlas is protected by copyright; you can freely use it for none profit research purposes, providing the above reference is cited. For other use please contact us through aicha.gin.brainatlas at gmail.com
The AICHA atlas includes 192 couples of homotopic regions for a total of 384 regions. AICHA is provided in the MNI stereotaxic space (MNI ICBM 152, Template sampling size of 2x2x2 mm3 voxels; bounding box, x = -90 to 90 mm, y = -126 to 91 mm, z = -72 to 109 mm).

AICHA atlas includes both regions located in the crown of the gyri (named Gyrus, region name beginning by “G_”) and regions located in the depth of the sulci (named Suclus, region name beginning by “S_”). In addition the subcortical nuclei were labeled separately (name Nucleus, region name beginning by “N_”).
Different parcels belonging to the same anatomical region were labeled with numbers (starting to 1). For example the precuneus show as 9 subparts labeled from G_Precuneus-1-L to G_Precuneus-9-L.

LPBA40 atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40) is a series of maps of brain anatomic regions. These maps were produced from a set of whole-head MRI of 40 human volunteers. Each MRI was manually delineated to identify a set of 56 structures in the brain, most of which are within the cortex. These delineations were then transformed into a common atlas space to produce a set of coregistered anatomical labels. The original MRI data were also transformed into the atlas space.
