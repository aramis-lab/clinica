# Educational Course on Pattern Recognition for Clinical Neuroimaging, OHBM 2018

*June 17th to 21st 2018*

A major application of pattern recognition in neuroimaging is the design of decision systems to support clinical decisions.

Such approaches aim to improve diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, schizophrenia or autism for instance.

The aim of this course was to teach how to design and validate pattern recognition for clinical applications in brain diseases.

The slides, Jupyter notebook and example dataset can be found in this [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17-DFtdDSJwIUMde0Fk6mP-UykQxRVqGG).
