## :warning: Known issue with Matlab and SPM12

[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) (whose implementation is based on Matlab) can sometimes randomly crash, causing a rather unreadable error in the console.
Those events are unpredictable. In case it occurs to you, please do the following:

- Check that you have a valid Matlab license.
- Before relaunching the command line, be sure to remove the content of the working directory (if you specified one).
