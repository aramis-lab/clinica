# Clinica Documentation

## [What is Clinica?](WhatIsClinica)

## Installation

Clinica can be installed on Mac OS X and Linux (CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu) machines, and possibly on Windows computers with a Linux Virtual Machine. We assume that users installing and using Clinica are comfortable with using the command line.

<!--!!! info "New release: Clinica 0.3.6!"
    We are very pleased to announce the release 0.3.6 of Clinica. The release notes are available here: [v0.3.6](http://bit.ly/2tfZjvh).-->

<!-- ### Installing Clinica from source -->
  - [Installation](./Installation)
  - [Third-party software](./Third-party)  

<!-- ### Installing Clinica using Docker
Another way to install Clinica is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker). The installation procedure of the Clinica Docker image, which contains everything required to launch any pipeline of Clinica, is explained [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/aramis/clinica_docker).    -->

<!-- ### Using Clinica on the ICM cluster
ICM members are encouraged to use the version of Clinica available on the cluster. Installation instructions are available [here](./ICMClusterInstallation). -->

### Dataset converters (`clinica convert`)
Clinica provides tools to curate several publicly available neuroimaging datasets and convert them to BIDS namely:

- `adni-2-bids` - [ADNI: Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative](Converters/ADNI2BIDS)
- `aibl-2-bids` - [AIBL: Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing](Converters/AIBL2BIDS)
- `nifd-2-bids` - [NIFD: Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia](Converters/NIFD2BIDS)
- `oasis-2-bids` - [OASIS: Open Access Series of Imaging Studies](Converters/OASIS2BIDS)

!!! note
    We provide converters for the datasets used in the [Aramis Lab](http://www.aramislab.fr/). Feel free to contact us if you are interested in another dataset or to contribute!


### I/O tools (`clinica iotools`)
- [Data handling tools for BIDS and CAPS compliant datasets](IO)

### Visualize pipeline outputs (`clinica visualize`)
Clinica allows visualization of the main outputs of some pipelines. Currently only supported for the [`t1-freesurfer` pipeline](Pipelines/T1_FreeSurfer).
