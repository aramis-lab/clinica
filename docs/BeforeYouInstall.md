# Before you install

## Availability of Clinica

Clinica can be installed on Mac OS X and Linux (Centos or Debian/Ubuntu) machines, and possibly on Windows computers with a Linux Virtual Machine.
We assume users installing and using Clinica are comfortable with using the command line.

Some Clinica pipelines use third-party software.
If you are planning to use any of these pipelines, you need to install before the necessary libraries.
For detailed info, click [here](./Third-party).

## Installing Clinica

Clinica installation is managed by [Conda](https://conda.io).
If you want to develop your code using Clinica or you want to contribute to the project, you can also install the package from the code source.
Detailed instructions are [here](./Installation).

## Installing Clinica using Docker

Another way to install Clinica is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).
The installation procedure of the Clinica Docker image, which contains everything required to launch any pipeline of Clinica, is explained [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/aramis/clinica_docker).

## Using Clinica on the ICM cluster
