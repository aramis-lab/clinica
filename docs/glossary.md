# Glossary

This page contains definitions for acronyms and terms used in the documentation of Clinica.

#### BIDS

**BIDS** stands for *Brain Imaging Data Structure*.

It is a simple and intuitive way to organize and describe neuro-imaging data.

#### CSV

**CSV** stands for *comma-separated values*.

It is a text file format that uses commas to separate values, and newlines to separate records.
A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, where each line of the file
typically represents one data record.
Each record consists of the same number of fields, and these are separated by commas in the CSV file.

#### GLM

**GLM** stands for *Generalized Linear Model*.

It can be seen as a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression.
The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response
variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement
to be a function of its predicted value.

#### JSON

**JSON** stands for *JavaScript Object Notation*.

It is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store
and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).
It is a commonly used data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.

#### PET

**PET** stands for *Positron Emission Tomography*.

It is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive substances known as radiotracers to
visualize and measure changes in metabolic processes, and in other physiological activities including
blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption.
Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body.

#### TSV

**TSV** stands for *Tab-Separated Values*.

It is a simple, text-based file format for storing tabular data.
Records are separated by newlines, and values within a record are separated by tab characters.
The TSV format is thus a delimiter-separated values format, similar to [CSV](#csv).

#### Voxel

A **voxel** represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space.
