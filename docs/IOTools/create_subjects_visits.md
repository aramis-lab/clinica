# `create-subjects-visits` - Generate the list all subjects and visits of a given dataset

A TSV file with two columns (`participant_id` and `session_id`) containing the list of visits for each subject can be created as follows:

```shell
clinica iotools create-subjects-visits BIDS_DIRECTORY OUTPUT_TSV
```

where:

- `BIDS_DIRECTORY`: input folder of a BIDS compliant dataset,
- `OUTPUT_TSV`: output TSV file containing the subjects with their sessions.

Here is an example of the file generated by this tool:

```text
participant_id   session_id
sub-01           ses-M000
sub-02           ses-M024
sub-03           ses-M024
...
```

!!! note
    The format of the participant ID and the session ID follows the [BIDS standard](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec1.0.0.pdf).

!!! example

    ```shell
    clinica iotools create-subjects-visits /home/ADNI_BIDS/ adni_participants.tsv
    ```
